## Code0 Sandbox Templates

[![Publish E2B Templates](https://github.com/Code0App/templates/actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Code0App/templates/actions/workflows/publish.yml)
[![Build Templates](https://github.com/Code0App/templates/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Code0App/templates/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Sandbox images that power Code0 projects. These templates provide ready-to-run environments in E2B Cloud for building, previewing, and iterating on code generated by the app.

### What you get
- Consistent, isolated environments per project
- Preconfigured stacks for rapid iteration and first-render speed
- Cloud-hosted previews that can be resumed later

### Available templates
- nextjs-shadcn — Next.js 15 baseline paired with shadcn/ui
- nextjs-radixui — Next.js 15 baseline paired with Radix UI

### How the app selects a template
- By project setting in the database (preferred)
- If not set, the app can fall back to an environment variable template name

### Using templates in the app
- When you create or run a project, Code0 launches a sandbox using the project’s template
- The sandbox URL is returned and shown in the project’s thread as a preview
- Sandboxes can be paused and resumed to retain state between runs

### Versioning and compatibility
- Target: Node 20+/21+, Next.js 15, React 19
- Each template is self-contained and versioned independently through E2B
- Updates to template content are published; new sandboxes use the latest version

### Governance
- This repo is the source of truth for the official Code0 templates
